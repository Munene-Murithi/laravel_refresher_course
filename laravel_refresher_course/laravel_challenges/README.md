# Laravel Coding Challenge 🚀

Welcome to the Laravel Coding Challenge! This is your playground to flex your Laravel skills and bring some magic to data handling. Let’s dive into the tasks that will challenge your creativity and technical prowess:

## 1. Set the Stage: Create a Laravel Project 🎉
Kick things off by setting up a brand-new Laravel project. Your mission? Build a **users** table with the following fields:
- **name**: Because everyone needs an identity!
- **email**: Keep them connected.
- **phone**: Let’s not forget about good ol’ communication.
- **password**: Secure those accounts like a pro!

## 2. Populate the World: Factory & Seeder Magic 🪄
Once your table is ready, it’s time to fill it with life! Create a factory and a seeder that conjures **50,000 users** into existence. That’s right—bring on the virtual crowd!

## 3. Crafting CSVs: Artisan Command to the Rescue! 📜
Next, let’s get those users into a neat format. Build an Artisan command that generates CSV files containing the user data:
- Each file should contain **no more than 10,000 users**.
- Organize them in a newly created folder with the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-{random_time}-users`. Make it look spiffy!

## 4. Automate the Process: Scheduling for Success ⏰
Finally, let’s put your command on autopilot! Configure the Laravel scheduler to run this command at the **end of every week**. Your users will be generated without lifting a finger!
